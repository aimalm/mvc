# Our website is social media platfor where users send challenges to friends

   This is how it works;
-Add an image to your website.
-Invite a friend/family (another user) to that challenge.
-The person that is challenged has a limited time(it can be short like 24 hours, 1 week or longer ) to respond to the challenge,so be careful to not miss the deadline.


# Things to Improve 

-Connect two tables to each other in the database.
-Achieve to add another or multiple users to the page.
-Profile with the information of the user's page is also need to be improved.
-Add information about how the website works and some small steps to lead the new users.
-Make functionality of the search bar.
-Social media icons needs to be integrated so users can share their memories on facebook,instagram etc..
