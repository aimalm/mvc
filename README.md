# Shenenigans

Our website is where users can add photos on their page and write small descriptions.
-Add an image to your website.
-Invite a friend/family (another user) to that challenge.
-The person that is challenged has a limited time(it can be short like 24 hours, 1 week or longer ) fixed by the challengor,so be careful to not miss the deadline.


The fun part starts to invite other users(friends,family) to challenge them with their photo that needs to be replied with another photo of the challenged theme
